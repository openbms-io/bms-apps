## üéØ How You Can Help

We're actively seeking contributions in several key areas:

### High Priority Areas

1. **Supervisor Engine Core** (`packages/supervisor-engine`)

   - Runtime graph and node registry/evaluators
   - Deterministic scheduler (monotonic clock, drift-corrected)
   - I/O adapter for IoT Service (HTTP/WS; batching, debouncing, COV-first)
   - Bundle format/versioning/validation; preview execution utilities

2. **Headless Engine App** (`apps/headless-engine`)

   - Thin wrapper (CLI + local control API): deploy/reload/status/health
   - Atomic bundle management (staging ‚Üí activate ‚Üí rollback)
   - Health/readiness endpoints, structured logs

3. **BACnet Integration** (Phase 7) ‚Äî `apps/iot-supervisor-app`

   - Real BACnet device discovery
   - Network scanning and enumeration
   - BAC0 (GPL-3.0) integration or bacpypes3 (MIT) alternative

4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**

   - End-to-end and soak tests (timing, drift, network flaps)
   - Performance testing with large node graphs
   - Cross-platform/browser compatibility testing
   - Testing with real bacnet/ip controllers

5. **Documentation**
   - User guides and tutorials
   - API contracts (Engine control, IoT Service)
   - Deployment and setup guides (AGPL source link, release artifacts)

### Medium Priority Areas

1. **UI/UX Enhancements**

   - Canvas interaction improvements
   - Node design and usability
   - Mobile responsiveness

2. **DevOps & Infrastructure**
   - Docker containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Deployment automation

## üöÄ Setup

For prerequisites and full environment setup (install, dev servers, schema generation), follow the root README:

- See README.md ‚Üí Quick Start and Development sections
- Optional: run `pnpm run setup:hooks` to enable pre-commit hooks

## üç¥ Contributing via Fork & Pull Request

If you don't have direct write access to the repository, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit [https://github.com/openbms-io/supervisor](https://github.com/openbms-io/supervisor)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your copy at `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supervisor`

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone your fork (not the original)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supervisor.git
cd supervisor

# Add the original repo as "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/openbms-io/supervisor.git
```

### Step 3: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Never work directly on main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Examples:
# git checkout -b test/add-zustand-mock
# git checkout -b fix/database-connection
# git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Follow the TDD workflow described below for your changes.

### Step 5: Push to Your Fork

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type: clear description of changes

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Reference issue if applicable

Closes #issue-number"

git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Step 6: Create Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request" button
3. Ensure the base is `openbms-io/supervisor:main`
4. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Testing checklist

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

```bash
# Before starting new work, sync with upstream
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Then create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### Workflow Visual

```
Original Repo (openbms-io/supervisor)
        ‚Üì Fork
Your Fork (YOUR_USERNAME/supervisor)
        ‚Üì Clone
Your Local Machine
        ‚Üì Branch + Changes
Push to Your Fork
        ‚Üì Pull Request
Back to Original Repo
```

### Development Workflow

Our development process follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

#### For Schema Changes

```bash
cd packages/bms-schemas

# 1. Write failing test
# Edit .spec.ts file with new test case

# 2. Run test (should fail)
npm test

# 3. Implement schema
# Edit schema .ts file

# 4. Verify test passes and regenerate
npm test && pnpm run generate
```

#### For Frontend Components

```bash
cd apps/designer

# 1. Write failing component test
# Edit *.spec.tsx file

# 2. Run test (should fail)
pnpm test

# 3. Implement component
# Edit component .tsx file

# 4. Verify test passes
pnpm test
```

#### For Backend API

```bash
cd apps/iot-supervisor-app

# 1. Write failing API test
# Edit test_*.py file

# 2. Run test (should fail)
pytest tests/

# 3. Implement endpoint
# Edit src/main.py

# 4. Verify test passes
pytest tests/
```
